# KickStarter

Crowd funding ideas on the blockchain

User is allowed to create campaigns on the blockchain and people can contribute to the project. Each contributor will be marked as approver. The manager of the campaign can withdraw funds by creating withdraw requests and approvers can vote on the requests by verifying the genuinity. Manager can withdraw money if half of the approvers vote on the request.

Smart contract is developed in solidity, compiled by solc and deployed to Rinkeby network using web3.js. NodeJs is used on the server, ReactJs on the front-end and NextJs is used for routing.
